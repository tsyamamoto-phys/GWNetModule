# gwnet
---
Pytorch based deep learning modules for analyzing gravitational wave data.
It consists of neural network classes and loss functions.


## References
```illinois.py``` consists of the convolutional neural networks which is employed in George \& Huerta [1].

```TSYAutoencoder.py``` consists of the implementation of conditional variational autoencoder. This is useful for a rapid parameter estimation. This is originally proposed by Gabbard *et al.* (2019)[2]. They applied the conditional variational autoencoder for GW signals from merging binary black holes. I applied CVAE for ringdown graviational waves from merged remnant black holes [3].

In Gabbard's GitHub, you can find the code ```Vitamin_C``` which is based on TensorFlow.
